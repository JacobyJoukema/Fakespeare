# Fakespeare
## Overview
Fakespeare is a from scratch RNN Twitter bot trained to tweet like William Shakespeare. It is trained using his complete works minus his sonnets. The proof of concept is constructed in Java and the actual implementation is built in Python. The system uses numpy for matrix multiplication and manipulation. The twitter handle is @FakespeareBot
